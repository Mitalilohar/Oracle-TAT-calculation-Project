# **Job TAT (Turnaround Time) Calculation Report – Oracle ERP**  

## **Overview**  
The **Job TAT (Turnaround Time) Calculation Report** is an automated reporting tool within the **Oracle ERP Manufacturing Module**. It calculates the time taken to complete a **manufacturing job** for items across multiple inventory organizations. By providing a date range as input, users can analyze how long it takes for a job to be completed, helping in optimizing production efficiency and identifying bottlenecks.  

## **Key Features**  
- **Date-Based Calculation:** Users enter a **From Date** and **To Date**, and the report retrieves all relevant jobs initiated and completed within this period.  
- **Multi-Organization Support:** It fetches job completion times across different inventory organizations for a holistic view of production performance.  
- **Automated Processing:** Eliminates manual tracking by automatically computing TAT based on job start and completion dates.  
- **Comprehensive Insights:** Provides detailed analytics on job efficiency, helping businesses improve manufacturing workflows.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Uses optimized SQL queries and PL/SQL procedures to process large datasets efficiently.  

## **How It Works**  
1. **User Input:** The user provides a **From Date** and **To Date** as input parameters.  
2. **Job Selection:** The system retrieves all manufacturing jobs initiated and completed within the selected date range.  
3. **TAT Calculation:** The system calculates the time taken for each job from **creation to completion**.  
4. **Final Report:** The output displays job-wise turnaround times, offering valuable insights into production efficiency.  

## **Report Output**  
The generated report includes:  
- **Job Number & Description**  
- **Item Code & Item Description**  
- **Organization & Inventory Name**  
- **Job Start Date & Completion Date**  
- **Total Turnaround Time (TAT) in Days**  
- **Average Job TAT per Organization & Item**
